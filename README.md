#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the structured application of engineering principles to develop, operate, and maintain reliable software systems. Software engineering is crucial in the industry as it ensures the development of reliable, secure, and scalable software solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency. It helps businesses automate processes, reduce operational costs, and improve customer experience through well-designed applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The NATO Conference recognized software development as an engineering discipline to tackle growing complexity and project failures.
Structured Programming (1970s-1980s) – Introduced organized coding practices, improving software reliability and maintainability.
Agile Methodologies (2001) – The Agile Manifesto revolutionized development by promoting flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Defines project goals, feasibility, and resource requirements to ensure a structured development process.
Requirement Analysis – Identifies and documents functional and non-functional requirements based on stakeholder needs.
Design – Creates system architecture, user interfaces, and database structures to outline how the software will function.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate code based on the design specifications.
Testing – Verifies that the software functions correctly, identifying and fixing bugs before deployment.
Deployment – Releases the software for use, either in a testing environment or for full production.
Maintenance – Updates, fixes, and improves the software to ensure continued efficiency and relevance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology follows a structured, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. It is best suited for projects with clearly defined requirements and minimal expected changes, such as government systems or banking software. However, it lacks flexibility, making modifications difficult once development begins. Testing is done at the end, which can increase risks if issues arise late in the process.
In contrast, the Agile methodology is iterative and flexible, allowing continuous feedback and adjustments throughout development. It is ideal for dynamic projects like mobile apps and startup software, where requirements may evolve based on user feedback. Agile promotes collaboration, frequent testing, and faster delivery, reducing risks and improving adaptability compared to Waterfall.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer- Develop applications, programs and system using programming languages and frameworks. Maintain and update software to keep it functional
Quality Assurance Engineer- Tests software to identify bugs and ensure functionality meets requiremnts. Develops automated and manual testing strategies
Project Manager- Oversers project planning, excution and delivery. Manges timelines, resources and team cordination

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) play a crucial role in software development by providing a unified workspace with tools for coding, debugging, and testing. They enhance productivity by offering features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and built-in compilers. IDEs streamline development, reducing errors and improving efficiency. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm.
Version Control Systems (VCS) help manage changes in code by tracking modifications, enabling collaboration, and allowing developers to revert to previous versions if necessary. They prevent code conflicts in team environments and ensure project integrity. Examples include Git (with platforms like GitHub and GitLab) and Apache Subversion (SVN).
Both IDEs and VCS are essential for modern software development, ensuring efficiency, collaboration, and code reliability.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task. 
Solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
Software Accessibility and Usability - Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users. 
Solution: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.
Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
 Solution: adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. -

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It helps identify bugs early in development and ensures each unit works correctly. Example: Testing a single function that calculates user discounts.
Integration Testing – Verifies that different modules or components work together as expected. It ensures seamless communication between interconnected parts. Example: Testing an API's interaction with a database.
System Testing – Evaluates the complete software system to check compliance with requirements. It tests the software in an environment similar to real-world use. Example: Checking if an e-commerce website handles orders correctly.
Acceptance Testing – Determines whether the software meets user expectations and business requirements before deployment. It ensures the product is ready for release. Example: A client testing a web application to verify functionality before launch.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
Developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."
Improved Prompt:
"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry, focusing on diagnosis and patient care."
Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
More Specific – It narrows the topic to AI in healthcare rather than general technology.
Clear Focus – It directs the AI to discuss diagnosis and patient care, avoiding irrelevant details.
Concise Yet Detailed – It provides enough guidance without being overly complex.
